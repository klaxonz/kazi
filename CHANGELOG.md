## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- Multi-provider engine: OpenAI-compatible endpoints (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Kimi, Qwen,
  OpenRouter...), Anthropic Claude, and local Ollama — hand-rolled clients, no agent framework.
- Core agent loop: model asks, tools run, results feed back, up to a configurable round budget.
- Built-in tools: `list_dir`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `run_command` (with confirmation
  gate, optional allowlist, timeout, and output truncation), plus optional `fetch_url`.
- Streaming output with hand-written SSE parsing for both provider protocols.
- `kazi chat` interactive REPL with `/compact`, `/model`, `/save`, `/resume` internals;
  `kazi run "task"` headless mode with exit codes for scripts and CI.
- Session persistence and `--resume`.
- Configurable context trimming (keep system prompt, drop oldest turns over budget).
- Optional file-tool sandbox root and command auto-approval allowlist.
